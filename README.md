# 🛠️ Local Service Provider Finder App

A smart, map-based Android application that helps users in Pakistan **find trusted local service providers** (electricians, plumbers, carpenters, etc.) in their area — with contact info, ratings, reviews, and location-based discovery.

This project was developed as part of the **Object-Oriented Programming** course at **NUST**.

## 📱 Overview

- 📍 **Location-based search**
- 🧰 Profiles of service providers with contact info, pricing, and specialties
- ⭐ **User reviews and ratings**
- 🗺️ An **interactive map interface** to locate shops
- 🔐 Secure user **authentication via Firebase**
